\title{Produces hourly data of ERA5-Land for a single location}
\usage{
extract_land_clim(
  nc,
  long,
  lat,
  start_time,
  end_time,
  d_weight = TRUE,
  cds_version = "new"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nc}{character vector containing the path to the nc file. Use the
`build_era5_land_request` and `request_era5` functions to acquire an nc file with
the correct set of variables. Data within nc file must span the period
defined by start_time and end_time.}

\item{long}{longitude of the location for which data are required (decimal
degrees, -ve west of Greenwich Meridian).}

\item{lat}{latitude of the location for which data are required (decimal
degrees, -ve south of the equator).}

\item{start_time}{a POSIXlt or POSIXct object indicating the first day or hour
for which data are required. Encouraged to specify desired timezone as UTC (ERA5
data are in UTC by default), but any timezone is accepted.}

\item{end_time}{a POSIXlt or POSIXct object indicating the last day or hour for
which data are required. Encouraged to specify desired timezone as UTC (ERA5
data are in UTC by default), but any timezone is accepted.}

\item{d_weight}{logical value indicating whether to apply inverse distance
weighting using the 4 closest neighbouring points to the location defined by
`long` and `lat`. Default = `TRUE`.}

\item{cds_version}{specifies what version of the CDS (Climate Data Store) the
ERA5 data were queried from. Either "new" (queries made after Sept 2024) or
"legacy" (queries made before Sept 2024). This argument will be deprecated in
the future and only queries from the new CDS will be supported.}
}
\value{
a data frame containing hourly values for a suite of climate variables:

`obs_time` | the date-time (timezone specified in col timezone)

`temperature` | (degrees celsius)

`humidity` | specific humidity (kg / kg)

`pressure` | (Pa)

`windspeed` | (m / s)

`winddir` | wind direction, azimuth (degrees from north)

`szenith` | Solar zenith angle (degrees from a horizontal plane)

`timezone` | (unitless)
}
\description{
`extract_clim` takes an nc file containing hourly ERA5-Land climate
data, and for a given set of coordinates, produces an (optionally) inverse
distance weighted mean of each variable.
